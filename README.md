# texqlite
Converts text file to sqlite db.

# Installation
It's your choice. Just clone this repo, and use them.  
Or, you can put `#! /usr/bin/env python` in `texqlite.py`'s header, change it's name to `texqlite`, 
and move it to `/usr/bin/` or somewhere. 

# Usage.
* **Method 1:** Start using by `python texqlite.py -i`. This will open an interactive mode! 
* **Method 2:** To do it quickly, use this command: `python texqlite.py sample.txt`. And texqlite will just run by default setting. 
Currently, Method 2 is not supporting the multiple fields. It will be added soon. 
 
# Requirements
sqlite3
